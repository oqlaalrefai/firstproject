## the pain of growth that we will suffering from it 
there is a lot of problem and you will have to work hard to find a solution you will face a lack of understanding topics you will be out of comfort zone you will be busy all the time its the pain
but no gain without pain 

## Big O
its describe the complixity of algorithem and its describe the worst case (its related to time and space)

- O(1)
  its will run on the same time like variable
- O(n)
  performance will grow linearly with input data like loop
- O(NÂ²)
  performance is directly proportional to the square of the size of the input data like nested loop
- O(2^N)
   algorithm whose growth doubles with each addition to the input data set like recursive function
- O(log N)
The iterative halving of data sets (over or below the mdeian) produce a growth curve that peaks at the beginning and slowly flattens out as the size of the data sets increase.


## Names and Values in Python
- assignment give the variable values 
name have no type and value has no scope
x = 4
you can use print to print out the value of x:
print(x) 
if you assigned the value x to anew variable like y=x its mean that y point to 4 
and its not copy data its point to value thats mean you can assign the same value to multiple variables

*rebinding* is Changing a variable(int float string)
*mutating* is Changing a list
