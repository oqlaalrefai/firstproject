tags provide extra meaning and allow browsers to show users 
**Structural markup:** the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphsappropriate structure for the page.

pages
#### **Headings**

-Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a
code view.
** Visual editors **often resemble word processors.allow you to control the presentation of text.
** Code views** show you the code created by the visual editor so you can manually edit it, or so you can just enter new code yourself. It is often activated
using a button with an icon that says HTML or has angled brackets
#### Strong & Emphasis

add a
you can add border around any of the boxes, to style Boxes :
Width and height Borders (color, width, and style) Background color and images Position in the browser window.
to style text :
Typeface,Size,Color,Italics, bold, uppercase,lowercase, small-caps
A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
  - selector is the name of html tag that we want to style
  - declaration is the type of style
- you can specify several selector in one rule using comma between each selector and You can specify several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon
ex : p{font-family :arial;}
- CSS Properties Affect How El ements Are Dis played
#### to use css there are three ways :
  - **external:**The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page ex : ``` <link href="css/styles.css" type="text/css"
rel="stylesheet" /> ```
An HTML page can use more than one CSS style sheet.
  - **Internal :** <style> element which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page.it should use the type attribute to indicate
that the styles are specified in CSS. ex  ```<style type="text/css">
body {
font-family: arial;
background-color: rgb(185,179,175);}
h1 {
color: rgb(255,255,255);}
</style>  ```
  - **inline** :inside the html opening tag using style attribute
### Selector
* Universal Selector ex : * {} Targets all elements on the page
* Type Selector ex : h1, h2, h3 {} Targets the <h1>, <h2> and <h3> elements
* Class Selector ex : .note {} Targets any element whose class attribute has a value of note
* ID Selector ex : #introduction {} Targets the element whose id attribute has a value of introduction
* Child Selector ex : li>a {} Targets any <a> elements that are children of an <li> element
* Descendant Selector ex : p a {} Targets any <a> elements that sit inside a <p> element,
* Adjacent Sibling Selector ex : h1+p {} Targets the first <p> element after any <h1> element
* General Sibling Selector ex : h1~p {} If you had two <p> elements that are siblings of an <h1> element,this rule would apply to both
- LAST RULE If the two selectors are identical,the latter of the two will take precedence.
- SPECIFICITY If one selector is more specific than the others, the more specific rule will take precedence over more general ones.
- IMPORTANT You can add !important after any property value to indicate that it should be considered more important than other rules that apply to the same element
### Inheritance
- If you specify the font-family or color properties on the <body> element, they will apply to most child elements. This is because the value of the font-family property is inherited by child elements.
- background-color or border properties; they are not inherited by child elements

### use External Style Sheets advantages
1- All of your web pages can share the same style sheet. This is achieved by using the <link> does not need to be repeated in every page
2- The HTML code will be easier to read and edit because it does not have lots of CSS rules in the same document.

- If you are just creating a single page, you might decide to put the rules in the same file to - keep everything in one place.
- If you have one page which requires a few extra rules (that are not used by the rest of the site), you might consider using CSS in the same page
