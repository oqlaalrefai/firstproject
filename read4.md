## java script
programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web and its enables you to create dynamically updating content, control multimedia, animate images, and pretty much everything 

* js variable : 1-number 2-float 3-boolian 4-string 5-character
you dont have to determine the type of variable just enter its value
ex : var = True

* **Blocking code** :the browser is blocked from continuing to handle user input and perform other tasks until the web app returns control of the processor.

* **thread** is basically a single process that a program can use to complete tasks. Each thread can only do a single task at once

JavaScript is traditionally single-threaded. Even with multiple cores, you could only get it to run tasks on a single thread, called the main thread

 Web workers allow you to send some of the JavaScript processing off to a separate thread, called a worker so that you can run multiple JavaScript chunks simultaneously



Asynchronous JavaScript: such as fetching resources from a server.

 ### APIs
  are programming features for manipulating different aspects of the browser and operating system the site is running on, or manipulating data from other web sites or services. 

Fetching data from the server Another very common task in modern websites and applications is retrieving individual data items from the server to update sections of a webpage without having to load an entirely new page.

Equality comparisons and sameness JavaScript provides three different value-comparison operations: strict equality using ===, loose equality using ==, and the Object.is() method.

#### **Closures**
A closure is the combination of a function and the lexical environment within which that function was declared.
