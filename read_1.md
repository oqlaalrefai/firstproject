# component 
is a modular, portable, replaceable, and reusable set of well-defined functionality that encapsulates its implementation and exporting it as a higher-level interface.

- The primary objective of component-based architecture is to ensure component reusability
- *standard component frameworks* such as :
COM/DCOM, JavaBean, EJB, CORBA, .NET, web services, and grid services

- Component-oriented software design advantages:
  - Reduced time in market and the development cost by reusing existing components.
  - Increased reliability with the reuse of the existing components

- A software component can be defined as a unit of composition with a contractually specified interface and explicit context dependencies only

- component can have three different views:
  âˆ’ object-oriented view
  - conventional view
  - process-related view.
- Characteristics of Components :
  - Reusability
  - Replaceable
  - Not context specific
  - Extensible
  - Encapsulated
  - Independent

- the advantages of using component based architecture :
  - Ease of deployment 
  - Reduced cost
  - Ease of development 
  - Reusable
  - Modification of technical complexity
  - Reliability 
  - System maintenance and evolution 
  - Independent

## Props 
is a special keyword in React, which stands for properties and is being used for passing data from one component to another.

- But the important part here is that data with props are being passed in a uni-directional flow. (one way from parent to child)

- *props data is read-only*

### how to use Props :
1- define an attribute and its value(data)
2- Then pass it to child component(s) by using Props
3- render the Props Data

### What is the flow of props?
we pass props into a React component and props bring all the necessary data.
